After installing Oracle 19c, here are the next steps:

### 1. **Verify the Installation**
Ensure that Oracle Database is properly installed and running:  
- Open a terminal (or command prompt) and check the status of the database:
  ```sh
  sqlplus / as sysdba
  ```
  If successful, it will connect to the database.

### 2. **Set Up Environment Variables (if not set)**  
For Linux: Add these to `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`:
  ```sh
  export ORACLE_HOME=/path/to/oracle/home
  export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
  export ORACLE_SID=your_database_sid
  ```

### 3. **Check and Configure the Listener**
- Check if the listener is running:
  ```sh
  lsnrctl status
  ```
- If it's not running, start it:
  ```sh
  lsnrctl start
  ```
- To configure it, edit `listener.ora` (usually found in `$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin`).

### 4. **Create a New Database (if needed)**
If you didnâ€™t create a database during installation, use `DBCA`:
  ```sh
  dbca
  ```
Follow the GUI or CLI instructions to create a database.

### 5. **Create a New Schema/User**
- Connect to SQL*Plus as SYSDBA:
  ```sh
  sqlplus / as sysdba
  ```
- Create a new user (schema):
  ```sql
  CREATE USER my_schema IDENTIFIED BY my_password;
  ```
- Grant privileges:
  ```sql
  GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, DBA TO my_schema;
  ```

### 6. **Test the Connection**
Try connecting with the newly created user:
```sh
sqlplus my_schema/my_password@localhost:1521/your_db_service_name
```

Do you need a specific configuration for your project?
